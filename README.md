# Markdown Viewer #
A simple markdown viewer (and perhaps editor) built with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [marked](https://github.com/chjj/marked)

## Usage ##
* Clone the repo
* Install all the necessary dependancies with `npm install`
* Start the app with `npm start`
* You can also generate the documentation with `npm run doc`. You need to have jsDoc installed (`npm install -g jsdoc`.)
